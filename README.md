Analysis notebooks for the scRNA-Seq tutorials of the 2018 Stem Cell Network RNA-Seq workshops.

### Getting the data
The data is currently contained in the zipped file "pbmc8k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz" in the "data" folder. Simply unzip it and it should be good to go.

### Accessing the material
All of the material for the workshop is in the notebooks folder. You can open the Markdown (.md) files to see all of the code and plot outputs, and you can also open the .Rmd files in RStudio and work with the code there.
