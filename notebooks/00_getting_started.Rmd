# Why did we do scRNA-seq and what do we hope to get from it?

scRNA-Seq results in some pretty massive datasets and without clear objectives from the start, it can be easy to get lost in the data, mindlessly flipping from plot to plot, waiting for something to jump out at you.

* What cell types exist in PBMCs?
  +What are the proportions of each cell type?
* What genes are unique markers for each population?
* Can we identify phenotypic plasticity within certain cell types?
